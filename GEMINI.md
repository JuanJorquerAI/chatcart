# ChatCart — Gemini / Antigravity compatibility

Goal: keep the project easy to continue with Gemini-based agents (Antigravity).

## Principles
- Keep docs in Markdown with clear task lists.
- Keep commands explicit and reproducible.
- Avoid exotic build tooling.

## Files agents should start with
- `documentation/specs/00-prd.md`
- `documentation/specs/01-architecture.md`
- `documentation/specs/02-backlog.md`
- `PLAN.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
